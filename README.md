## Introduction

Airbnb has become a popular platform for travelers to find unique and affordable accommodations. This EDA project aims to uncover interesting patterns and trends within the Airbnb dataset, helping users, hosts, and potential investors make informed decisions.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from [Insert Dataset Source Here], containing information about Airbnb listings, including details such as price, location, property type, and more.

## Dependencies

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed before running the code:

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebooks (for interactive exploration)

You can install the dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
pandas==1.3.3
numpy==1.21.1
matplotlib==3.4.3
seaborn==0.11.2
jupyter==1.0.0

You can copy these lines into a file named requirements.txt in your project directory. When you run pip install -r requirements.txt, it will install these specific versions of the mentioned libraries.

Feel free to modify the versions based on your preferences or any specific compatibility requirements you may have. To find the latest versions, you can check the Python Package Index (PyPI) or use pip freeze after installing the packages to see the versions that were installed and then update the requirements.txt file accordingly.
## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/airbnb-eda-python.git
cd airbnb-eda-python
```

2. Download the dataset and place it in the `data` directory.

3. Open Jupyter Notebook or your preferred Python environment.

## Usage

Execute the Jupyter Notebook `Airbnb_EDA.ipynb` to run the analysis and explore the insights generated from the Airbnb dataset.

```bash
jupyter notebook Airbnb_EDA.ipynb
```

Follow the instructions and comments within the notebook to navigate through the analysis.

## Analysis

The analysis covers the following key areas:

- **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, outliers, and ensuring data quality.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Visualizing and exploring patterns in the data.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Conducting statistical tests to validate findings.
- **Insights:** Summarizing key takeaways and actionable insights.
